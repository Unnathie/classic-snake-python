# 🐍 Nostalgic Snake Game (Python Turtle)

A retro-inspired Snake game built with **Python's Turtle Graphics** module — because sometimes you just need to relive the pixelated glory days, one green block at a time.  
🕹️ Eat the magenta turtle-food, grow absurdly long, and inevitably crash into yourself (or a wall) in a blaze of glory.

*Behold: the most intense rectangle-chasing experience since 1976.*

## 🎮 Features
- 🐍 Smooth snake movement with no teleporting magic — just clean turns and pixel-perfect precision.
- 🍬 Randomly spawned, magenta turtle-shaped food for that extra “what am I even eating?” vibe.
- 📈 Live score tracking so you can brag… until you mess up.
- 💀 Big, unapologetic GAME OVER message with skull emojis — because subtlety is overrated.
- 🧩 Modular code: separate files for Snake, Food, and Scoreboard. Organized chaos.
